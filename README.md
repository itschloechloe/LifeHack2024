# WICKED Coders, LifeHack2024
## About 
This is the hack that our group has come up with: **PatrolPro**, for LifeHack 2024.

## Theme
The theme that we have chosen is Theme 3: **Safeguarding Public Security**, Subtheme 1: **Strengthening Domestic Security**.
Currently, law enforcement agencies are constantly faced with the challenge of allocating resources to combat or prevent crime effectively due to the increasing complexity and diversification of security issues.
### Problem Statement
Strengthening domestic security involves a critical need to explore solutions that utilise crime data analysis and patrol route optimisation. Design a solution to seamlessly integrate crime hotspots analysis with patrol route optimisation allowing law enforcement agencies to prioritise on higher crime risk areas and shorten emergency response times.

## Building of Hack

## Features
1. Identify hotspots  with recent crime activity and receive alerts for new crime activity
2. Real-time updates on  available manpower across different neighbourhood stations
3. Illustrating optimal patrol route, maximising coverage of crime hotspots
4. Illustarting optimal emergency route, shortening response time
   
## Usage of Software
1.

## Future Possibilites
Create a mobile app for patrol units to receive real-time updates, optimized routes, and report their status.
Analyse the severity of crimes committed and allocate manpower accordingly with the frequency.

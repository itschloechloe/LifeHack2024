# WICKED Coders, LifeHack2024
## About 
This is the hack that our group has come up with: **PatrolPro**, for LifeHack 2024.

## Theme
The theme that we have chosen is Theme 3: **Safeguarding Public Security**, Subtheme 1: **Strengthening Domestic Security**.
Currently, law enforcement agencies are constantly faced with the challenge of allocating resources to combat or prevent crime effectively due to the increasing complexity and diversification of security issues.
### Problem Statement
Strengthening domestic security involves a critical need to explore solutions that utilise crime data analysis and patrol route optimisation. Design a solution to seamlessly integrate crime hotspots analysis with patrol route optimisation allowing law enforcement agencies to prioritise on higher crime risk areas and shorten emergency response times.

## Building of Hack
First, we had an idea in mind that we wanted to create a system whereby law enforcement officers could monitor both past and real-time activities, and it could plan their routes accordingly. Our end goal was to create an interactive map, showcasing the essential details. From then on, we would have to collect data on criminal activities committed and their accompanying details. From there on, we could cluster the areas where crime has occurred and identify a hotspot. These hotspots would then be the marking stones for the system to plan a patrol route, taking into account other factors such as coverage of hotspots, available manpower etc. Emergency response can also be handled efficiently as the system would receive an alert and notify patrolling officers about the shortest route there to tackle the issue at hand. 

## Features
1. Identify hotspots with recent crime activity and receive alerts for new crime activity
2. Real-time updates on available manpower across different neighbourhood stations
3. Illustrating optimal patrol route, maximising coverage of crime hotspots
4. Illustarting optimal emergency routes, shortening response time
   
## Usage of Software
It will be a live map system on a monitor with a central server connecting to all neighbourhood post police stations. 

## Future Possibilites
- Create a mobile app for patrol units to receive real-time updates, optimized routes, and report their status.
- Analyse the severity of crimes committed and allocate manpower accordingly with the frequency.
